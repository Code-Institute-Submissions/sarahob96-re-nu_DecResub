 <h2> Site Overview </h2>
 
 The goal of my project - RENU Apparel was to create a bright and energetic site that allows the user to purchase sustainable items of clothing/accessories that can be used for a workout or just for everyday comfy wear.  The site allows the user to purchase items from a number of categories including tops, bottoms, accessories and Sports bras. The user can purchases items, logged in or not. Logged in users however get access to writing reviews of products and become a member of 'renu go' - an incentive to users for being apart of the renu community. 
 
 
 <h2> User Experience </h2>
 
 <h4> The strategy Plane </h4>
 
RENU apparel is B2C - Business to Consumer business that sells sustainable activewear and accessories. In today's market, sustainable clothing pieces that are versatile and sustainable are extremely popular and cater to a wide audience. A large portion of the target audience for Renu will be women who have an interest in working out/ have an active lifestyle. The target audience will not be restricted however to just women with a very sporty lifetyle as the site also advertise the products as comfortable and sustainable. This also appeals to not only younger sporty women but also older customers who are eco conscious and value comfy clothing.
