 <h2> Site Overview </h2>
 
 The goal of my project - RENU Apparel was to create a bright and energetic site that allows the user to purchase sustainable items of clothing/accessories that can be used for a workout or just for everyday comfy wear.  The site allows the user to purchase items from a number of categories including tops, bottoms, accessories and Sports bras. The user can purchases items, logged in or not. Logged in users however get access to writing reviews of products and become a member of 'renu go' - an incentive to users for being apart of the renu community. 
 
 
 <h2> User Experience </h2>
 
 <h3> The strategy Plane </h3>
 
RENU apparel is B2C - Business to Consumer business that sells sustainable activewear and accessories. In today's market, sustainable clothing pieces that are versatile and sustainable are extremely popular and cater to a wide audience. A large portion of the target audience for Renu will be women who have an interest in working out/ have an active lifestyle. The target audience will not be restricted however to just women with a very sporty lifetyle as the site also advertise the products as comfortable and sustainable. This also appeals to not only younger sporty women but also older customers who are eco conscious and value comfy clothing.

  <h3> The Scope Plane </h3>
  
While designing the project, I wanted the user to have a positive experience while on the site, both UX and mood wise. A website has the ability to influence a persons mood based on the theme/design of the site and the layout used. 
To provide a positive experience while on the site, the responsive navigation bar and links in the footer allow for the user to access all parts of the site easily.
  
 A number of features will be used to provide the user with a positive experience.
  
  1. The site navigation bar will include a link to all product categories, the shopping bag, profile, and login/logout/register features 
  
 2. A search bar will be placed in the header of the site to allow the user to search for products on any page of the site.
  
 3. A landing page with a striking hero image that conveys to the user what the site is for.
  
 4. A Custom 404 page that appears if the user stumbles upon a page that is not available
  
 5. A Products page that displays all products, and the option to view specific categories
  
 6. Product information for individual items will be display on the individual product pages.
  
  7. A user profile page will display the users information that can be used in future orders.
  
  8.  Responsive design so users get a pleasant viewing experience across all devices.
 
  9. A reviews section that will allow users to leave their opinion of products
  
 10.  A contact page that will let the users reach out to the store.
 
 
  <h3> The Structure Plane </h3> 
  
When the user arrives on site, they will be greeted with a bright and energetic hero image below a clear and concise nav bar. A search bar will be display to the user at the top of the site allowing for the user to quickly find what they are looking for without having to browse.
The user will have the ability to filter the items by price and name and also look for a product by category of choice.
  
Users will have the option to add items to their bag and checkout without having to create an account. However, only signed in 'members' have access to writing reviews and to the exclusive 'renu go' online community. 
  
Anytime an item is added to the bag, a user is logged in/out, the user will recieve a pop up message to inform them that the task was completed.
                       
The site has the following apps
  1) Home
  2) Products - contains all product information- including product reviews
  3) Profile 
  4) Bag 
  5) Checkout
  6) Information - contains the contact us information and the renu go membership page
  
  
  <h3> The Skeleton Plane </h3>
  
  - Wireframes here
  
  <h4> The Database </h4>
  
  - Throughout development I used SQLite as this is the default database used when using django. When deployed on Heroku, PostgreSQL database is used. 

  <h4> Models </h4>
  
  The following models are used for the site: 
  
  
  
  
  <h3> The Surface Plane </h3>
  
  <h4> Colour Scheme </h4>
  
  My main vision for the site was to be bright and energetic to effectively convey the active and positive experience one has when wearing and using the RENU products The colours used on the site therefore were bright but definate. I used Colourspace to generate a palette that was then applied to the site.
  <img src = "assets/images/color-scheme.png">
  
  - The light aqua green colour was used most across the site #5EBAB1.
  - A light pink was used throughout the site for the background colours of buttons and in the footer ##FFE8FF.
  - A lilac purple #C9A4D5 was then used sparingly acrossed the site also.
  
  <h4> Typography </h4>
  
 The font families used across the site was 'Alegreya Sans SC'' and  'Abril Fatface'. The Abril Fatface font gives a fancy and eye catching look to the site and is used to draw the attention of the user to the main features used on the site.
  
  <h4> Favicon </h4>
   - I created a Favicon on the favicon site incorporating the most used colour of the site.
  
  <h4> Images </h4>
  
  - Images used were gotten across a number of stock photo sites including
     - Shutterstock
     - Pexels
     - Unsplash 
     - Pixabay
  
  
  <h2> Features </h2>
  
  <h3> Current Features </h3>
  
  - Navigation bar
     - The nav bar is one of the main site features as it is visible from across the whole site.   On smaller devices it shrinks down into a collapsable menu that opens into a dropdown menu when clicked on. It contains links to most elements of the site, allowing for easy navigation throughtout the site
  
  <img src = "assets/images/header-fullscreen.png">
  
  - Search bar
     -  The search bar is positioned at the top of the site just below the nav bar. It allows the user to quickly search for an item if they already have something in mind and avoids having to browse.

  - Hero Image
    - The striking hero image is displayed to the user as they reach the site. Its a bright and energetic photo that conveys the feeling of the site and the products to the user instantly. The group photo of friends doing a workout conveys the theme of the site instantly to the user. The hero image text also does this stating 'uniform' and 'everyday fit'. Both modern day terms used to describe an outfit. 
    <img src = "assets/images/hero-img.png">
  
  - Shop by Category
    - Below the hero image is the 'shop by category' section of the home page. On large screens it displays as 5 different sections showing all 5 shopping categories - bottoms, sweatshirts, accessorties, tops and sports bras. On smaller devices this decreases down to 4 cateogories for UX purposes. This quickly and effectively displays to the customer whats on offer from the store.
